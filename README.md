# 👋 Hello World App

A simple **Hello World** project built with **React** and **TypeScript**, scaffolded with [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/). It serves as a minimal starter to demonstrate a clean React + TypeScript setup — perfect for learning, prototyping, or as a foundation for your next project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn**

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/michelbr84/hello-world-app.git
   cd hello-world-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   > The `prepare` script will automatically set up Husky git hooks after install.

3. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will open automatically at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). The page will hot-reload whenever you make edits.

---

## 📜 Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

| Script              | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm start`         | Runs the app in development mode at `http://localhost:3000`. |
| `npm test`          | Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. |
| `npm run build`     | Builds the app for production to the `build/` folder. |
| `npm run eject`     | ⚠️ Ejects from Create React App (one-way operation, use with caution). |
| `npm run lint`      | Runs ESLint on all `.ts` / `.tsx` files under `src/`. |
| `npm run lint:fix`  | Runs ESLint and automatically applies safe fixes where possible. |
| `npm run format`    | Formats all source files with Prettier (`.ts`, `.tsx`, `.css`). |
| `npm run format:check` | Verifies that all source files match Prettier formatting without modifying them (useful for CI). |

---

## 🛠️ Developer Tools

### Code Style

This project uses **Prettier** for consistent formatting and **ESLint** for static analysis. Both share a single configuration so formatting rules never clash with lint rules.

```bash
# Auto-format your code
npm run format

# Check formatting without writing
npm run format:check

# Lint your code
npm run lint

# Lint and apply auto-fixers
npm run lint:fix
```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Git hooks (via [Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)) automatically run on every commit:

- **`pre-commit`** — `lint-staged` runs ESLint `--fix` and Prettier `--write` on staged files
- **`commit-msg`** — `commitlint` enforces [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format

The hooks are installed automatically by the `prepare` script after `npm install`. To bypass them in an emergency, use `git commit --no-verify` (not recommended).

**Commit message examples:**

```bash
# ✅ Valid ✅ passes commitlint
git commit -m "feat: add greeting component"
git commit -m "fix: resolve hot-reload crash"
git commit -m "docs: update README with setup steps"
git commit -m "chore: bump dependencies"

# ❌ Invalid ❌ will be rejected
git commit -m "added stuff"
```

### Editor Integration

For the best experience, install these editor extensions:

- **VS Code**: [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) + [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
- **WebStorm / JetBrains**: ESLint and Prettier are bundled out of the box.

## 🏗️ Built With

- **[React](https://reactjs.org/)** — A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)** — Typed JavaScript at any scale.
- **[Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)** — A comfortable setup for React projects with no build configuration.
- **[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)** — Pluggable linter for JavaScript and TypeScript.
- **[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)** — Opinionated code formatter.
- **[Husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/)** — Modern Git hooks made easy.
- **[lint-staged](https://github.com/okonet/lint-staged)** — Run linters on staged files.
- **[Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/)** — Lint commit messages against Conventional Commits.

---

## 🌍 Browser Support

The production build supports browsers that meet the following criteria:

- Production: >0.2%, not dead, not op_mini all
- Development: Last 1 version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
npm test
```

This launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the [Create React App testing docs](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/running-tests/) for more information.

---

## 📦 Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build is minified, optimized, and the filenames include hashes for cache busting. The production-ready files will be generated in the `build/` directory and can be deployed to any static hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3, etc.).

---

## 🌐 Deployment

A live demo is automatically published to **GitHub Pages** on every push to `master` via the CI workflow:

👉 **https://michelbr84.github.io/hello-world-app/**

How it works:

1. The `quality` job runs lint, tests, coverage, and `npm run build` on every push and pull request.
2. On a push to `master` (only), the `deploy` job runs after `quality` succeeds.
3. The deploy job rebuilds the app, uploads `build/` as a Pages artifact, and publishes it via the official `actions/deploy-pages` action.

One-time setup (manual, outside the codebase):

1. Go to **Settings → Pages** for the repository.
2. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"**.
3. That's it — subsequent pushes to `master` will trigger a fresh deploy.

The `homepage` field in `package.json` is set to the Pages URL so Create React App generates correct absolute asset paths under the `/hello-world-app/` sub-path.

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1. Fork the project
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3. Make sure `npm run lint` and `npm run format:check` pass
4. Commit your changes using a [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) message — e.g. `git commit -m 'feat: add some AmazingFeature'`
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
6. Open a Pull Request

> 🚀 The pre-commit hook will automatically lint and format your staged files, and the commit-msg hook will verify that your commit message follows the Conventional Commits format.
